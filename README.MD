#Discord Bot for Raspberry Pi

This project is a personal research project and is made publicly available 
for portfolio purposes only.

##Description

The purpose of this project is to create a Discord bot that runs on a 
Raspberry Pi and controls a Pi Pico in a local network. The Pi Pico will 
enable remote power control of a computer from a PC connected to the 
internet.

I am developing this project independently and have chosen to work with 
Java and avoid the use of external libraries as a learning exercise.
